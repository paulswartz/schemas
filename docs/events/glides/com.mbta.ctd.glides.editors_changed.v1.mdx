# editors_changed

event type: `com.mbta.ctd.glides.editors_changed.v1`

Inspectors sign in and out of editing specific trainsheets. This event publishes changes to who is editing.

Since one action by an inspector might result in
multiple changes, for example if they sign out of one location and in to another, the changes are published in a list.

In practice, we limit each location to have only one editor, and limit each editor to only one location, but that rule may or may not change and this event schema doesn't guarantee that.

Note that the author may or may not match the editors in changes, since inspectors can change whether other people are editing.
For example, when an inspector takes over editing at a location, they may sign out the previous editor.
Then they would issue a stop change for the previous editor and a start change for themself.
